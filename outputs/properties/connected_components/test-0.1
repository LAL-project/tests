=====================
0 is in connected component 0 and is vertex 0 within its component
1 is in connected component 0 and is vertex 1 within its component
---------------------
0: 1
1: 0
    0 in the connected component is 0 in the original graph
    1 in the connected component is 1 in the original graph
