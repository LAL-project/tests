INSTRUCTIONS
============

All tests start with a single string, one of:
	-> ugraph
	-> dgraph

This tells the test what type of graph to use.


The following commands are available whether an input graph has been given or not.

** assert is_reachable NODE_1 NODE_2
	asserts that whether NODE_1 is reachable from NODE_2

** assert not_is_reachable NODE_1 NODE_2
	asserts that whether NODE_1 is not reachable from NODE_2

** assert has_dir_cycle
	asserts that the input graph has a directed cycle

** assert hasnt_dir_cycle
	asserts that the input graph does not have a directed cycle

** assert has_undir_cycle
	asserts that the input graph does not have a undirected cycle

** assert hasnt_undir_cycle
	asserts that the input graph does not have an undirected cycle

** output_graph
	Outputs the graph to standard output.



The following commands are only available when no input graph has been given.

** add_edge NODE_1 NODE_2
	Adds an edge to the only graph that the test is dealing with.

** init N
	Initialise the graph with N vertices.
