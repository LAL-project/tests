FORMAT OF COMMANDS
==================

+ insertion_sort_rand R s n:

	Sorts the 's' random values within the range [0,n] INCREASINGLY. The random values are generated 'R' times.

+ bit_sort_rand R s n:

	Sorts the 's' random values within the range [0,n] INCREASINGLY. The random values are generated 'R' times.
	
	The algorithm used is the memoriless bit sort.

+ bit_sort_mem_rand R s n:

	Sorts the 's' random values within the range [0,n] INCREASINGLY. The random values are generated 'R' times.
	
	The algorithm used is the bit sort with memory.

+ counting_sort_rand ORDER k R s n:

	Sorts the 's' random values within the range [0,n] either INCREASINGLY or DECREASINGLY. Each value is a 'k'-tuple. The random values are generated 'R' times.

+ counting_sort_nrand ORDER n a_1 .. a_n:
	
	Sorts the values a_1 ... a_n either INCREASINGLY or DECREASINGLY
