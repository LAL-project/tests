INSTRUCTIONS
============

All tests start with a single string, one of:
	-> ugraph
	-> dgraph

This tells the test what type of graph to use.


1. When an input graph is given
-------------------------------

** is_reachable NODE_1 NODE_2
	Output a message telling whether NODE_1 is reachable from NODE_2

** has_cycle
	Output a message telling whether the input graph has a cycle or not

** output_graph
	Outputs the graph to standard output.

2. When no input graph is given
-------------------------------

** add_edge NODE_1 NODE_2
	Adds an edge to the only graph that the test is dealing with.

** init N
	Initialise the graph with N vertices.

All of the options of section 2 are also allowed.
