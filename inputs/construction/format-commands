** create_graph GRAPH N
	Creates a graph of a certain number of vertices
	
** add_edge GRAPH VERTEX1 VERTEX2 true/false
	Adds an edge to a graph. Normalises (or not) the graph
	
** add_edges GRAPH N VERTEX1 VERTEX2 ... VERTEX_{2n-1} VERTEX_{2n} true/false
	Adds N edges to a graph. Normalises (or not) the graph
	
** assert
	Makes sure that something is true
	
	-- not_normalised GRAPH
		asserts that a graph is NOT normalised
		
	-- normalised GRAPH
		asserts that a graph IS normalised
		
	-- equal_graphs GRAPH1 GRAPH2
		asserts that two graphs are equal (here "equal" is not the
		same as "isomorphic"!)
	
	-- not_equal_graphs GRAPH1 GRAPH2
		asserts that two graphs are equal (here "equal" is not the
		same as "isomorphic"!)
	
	-- exists_edge GRAPH VERTEX1 VERTEX2
		asserts that a given edge exists
	
	-- not_exists_edge GRAPH VERTEX1 VERTEX2
		asserts that a given edge does NOT exist
	
	-- num_nodes GRAPH N
		asserts that the number of nodes is N
		
	-- num_edges GRAPH N
		asserts that the number of edges is N
	
** normalise GRAPH
	Normalise a graph
	
** assign GRAPH1 GRAPH2
	Assign graph 2 to graph 1
	
** disjoint_union GRAPH_RESULT GRAPH1 GRAPH2
	Make the disjoint union of GRAPH1 and GRAPH2 and store the result
	in GRAPH_RESULT
