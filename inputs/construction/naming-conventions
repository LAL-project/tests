NAMING CONVETIONS
=================

The format of the test files' names is as follows. All test files start with

	test-

Then follows the "family number" of the test. This is a three-digit number.
Finally, a three-digit number indicating the test number within the family.

Codes and types of graphs
-------------------------

	0: ugraph
	1: dgraph
	2: ftree
	3: rtree

We are currently using the following names:

	000: construction of ugraph
	001: construction of dgraph
	002: construction of ftree
	003: construction of rtree
	
	010: inspection of edges and elements of Q in ugraph
	011: inspection of edges and elements of Q in dgraph
	
	020: check iterators of constructed ugraph
	021: check iterators of constructed dgraph
		# no need to check other graphs
	
	030: read ugraph from disk
	031: read dgraph from disk
		# tests
		#	032: read ftree from disk
		#	033: read rtree from disk
		# are redundant
	
	042: convert a ftree to a rtree graph
	
	053: type of rtree
	
	063: sizes of rtree (of the tree and of the subtrees)
	
	073: retrieve subtree of a rooted tree
