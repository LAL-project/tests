NAMING CONVETIONS
=================

The format of the test files' names is as follows. All test files start with

	test-

Then follows the "family number" of the test. This is a three-digit number.
Finally, a three-digit number indicating the test number within the family.
Therefore


         Test number

	test-xxx.yyy

Codes and types of graphs
-------------------------

	0: ugraph
	1: dgraph
	2: utree
	3: dtree
	4: urtree
	5: drtree

We are currently using the following names:

	000: construction of ugraph
	001: construction of dgraph
	002: construction of utree
	003: construction of dtree
	004: construction of urtree
	005: construction of drtree

	010: inspection of edges and elements of Q in ugraph
	011: inspection of edges and elements of Q in dgraph

	020: check iterators of constructed ugraph
	021: check iterators of constructed dgraph
		# no need to check other graphs

	030: read ugraph from disk
	031: read dgraph from disk
		# tests
		#	032: read utree from disk
		#	033: read dtree from disk
		# are redundant
	034: read urtree from disk
	035: read drtree from disk

	045: convert a utree to a drtree graph
	
	055: type of drtree
	
	064: sizes of urtree (of the tree and of the subtrees)
	065: sizes of drtree (of the tree and of the subtrees)

	074: retrieve subtree of a rooted undirected tree
	075: retrieve subtree of a rooted directed tree
