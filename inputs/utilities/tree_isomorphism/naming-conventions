NAMING CONVENTIONS
==================

The format of the names is the following:

	test-x.y.nn.TT

where x is '0'/'1' depending on whether the test
contains pairs of non-isomorphic/isomorphic trees,
and 'y' is 'f'/'r' depending on whether we are testing
free or rooted trees.

The string 'nn' makes up a number of two digits which is the number of vertices of the trees.

The string 'TT' makes up a number of two digits which is the test number.
