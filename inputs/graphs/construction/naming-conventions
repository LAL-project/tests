NAMING CONVETIONS
=================

The format of the test files' names is as follows. All test files start with

     test-

Then follows the "family number" of the test 'xxx'; this is a three-digit number.
Then follows a dot '.' and another three-digit number 'yyy' indicating the test
number within the family.


              Test number

                  |
                 ---
        test-xxx.yyy
             ---
              |

         Family test
            number
