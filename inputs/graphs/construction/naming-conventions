NAMING CONVETIONS
=================

The format of the test files' names is as follows. All test files start with

	test-

Then follows the "family number" of the test. This is a three-digit number.
Finally, a three-digit number indicating the test number within the family.

Codes and types of graphs
-------------------------

	0: ugraph
	1: dgraph
	2: ftree
	3: rtree

We are currently using the following names:

	000: construction of ugraph
	001: construction of dgraph
	002: construction of ftree
	003: construction of rtree
	
	004: construction of ugraph using disjoint_union
	005: construction of dgraph using disjoint_union
	006: construction of ftree using disjoint_union
	007: construction of rtree using disjoint_union
	
	010: inspection of E and Q in ugraph
	011: inspection of E and Q in dgraph
	
	015: conversion of dgraph to ugraph.
	016: convert a ftree to a rtree
	017: convert a rtree to a ftree
	
	020: check iterators of constructed ugraph
	021: check iterators of constructed dgraph
		# no need to check other graphs
	
	030: read a list of edges and convert into an undirected graph
	031: read a list of edges and convert into a directed graph
	032: read a head vector and convert into a free tree
	033: read a head vector and convert into a rooted tree
	
	053: check validity of the orientation of the tree's edges
	
	063: sizes of rtree (of the tree and of the subtrees)
	
	073: retrieve subtree of a rooted tree
