Expectation and Variance of C tests' format
===========================================

Directories:
* all-trees: to test the algorithm for computing V[C] on *all* the
	trees of a given size.
* brute-force: useful for generating new base outputs.
* general-formula: to test the formula of V[C] on general trees.
* trees: to test the algorithm for computing V[C] on trees stored
	in files.

Contents of input files:
	
- Type: the type is always the same:
	TYPE properties-exp_var_C

- Input: it is allowed to specify input 0.

- Body:
	* In order to test the brute-force algorithm, write:
		BODY
		brute-force
	
	* In order to test the algorithm implementing the general formula,
	write:
		BODY
		formula
	
	* In order to test the algorithm for trees, write:
		BODY
		trees
	
	* In order to test the algorithm for trees, on all trees of a given
	size, write:
		BODY
		all-trees
		amount-sizes sizes
	
	For example, the test:
		BODY
		all-trees
		7	2 3 4 5 6 7 8
	tests all trees of 2 vertices, all trees of 3 vertices, ...

	* In order to test the algorithm for forests, write:
		BODY
		forests
	
	* In order to test the algorithm for forests consisting on several
	unlabelled trees, each generated uniformly at random, write
		BODY
		mixed-trees
		replicas
		amount-tests tests
	Each test in "tests" is a pair (num-trees size-trees), where "num-trees"
	is the amount of trees in the forest, and "size-trees" is the size
	of each tree to be generated.
	
	For example, the test:
		BODY
		mixed-trees
		1000
		4   3 4   5 7   4 19   1 20
	tests the algorithm on:
	-> a forest of 3 unlabelled trees generated u.a.r. each of 4 vertices
	-> a forest of 5 unlabelled trees generated u.a.r. each of 7 vertices
	-> a forest of 4 unlabelled trees generated u.a.r. each of 19 vertices
	-> a forest of 1 unlabelled tree generated u.a.r. of 20 vertices
	Each of these forests will be generated 1000 times
