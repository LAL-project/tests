# Test suite for LAL

The algorithms in this library are thoroughly tested during their development. It is our intention to continue extending the library, but also to make the algorithms more efficient every day. For this reason, we need automated tests that free us from the burden of carrying out the thousands of tests needed to be completely sure that the algorithms work every time we make the slightest change.

## Dependencies

These tests require LAL to be installed in your system. Go to [LAL's webpage](https://github.com/LAL-project/linear-arrangement-library/tree/21.07) and follow the installation instructions.

## Compilation of the C++ tests

We wrote different sets of instructions for compiling the tests for

- Windows in [this](https://github.com/LAL-project/tests/blob/21.07/instructions/compilation-tests-windows.md) file.
- Linux in [this](https://github.com/LAL-project/tests/blob/21.07/instructions/compilation-tests-linux.md) file.

## Graphs for testing

[This](https://github.com/LAL-project/tests/blob/21.07/graphs) directory contains several graphs used for testing.

## Execution of the tests

See [this](https://github.com/LAL-project/tests/blob/21.07/instructions/tests-execution-instructions.md) file for instructions on how to execute the tests.

## Format of the tests

The general format of the tests we use is explained [here](https://github.com/LAL-project/tests/blob/21.07/instructions/tests-format.md).
