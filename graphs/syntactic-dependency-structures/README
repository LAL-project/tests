SUMMARY
=======

The data in this folder was provided by CARLOS GÓMEZ-RODÍGUEZ, Ph. D, (LYS Group: http://www.grupolys.org/~cgomezr/).
This data is a subset of the dataset published in the HARVARD DATAVERSE (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/XHRIYX&version=1.0)

FILE NAMING
===========

Each file name has the following format

	sen-x
	sen-x--y

where 'x' is a two-digit number indicating the number of vertices of the trees and 'y' is a one-digit number indicating the part of the original file (some files too large for Github, so they had to be split into several smaller files).

FILE FORMAT
===========

Each file contains a single-line header

	tree;classes

The remaining lines contain an arrangement of a tree followed by a ';' and a comma-separated list of projective classes it belongs to.
